# betterPrism
A cleaner PrismLauncher frontend in Pygame.

2. Run the betterPrism installer in "releases".
3. Open PrismLauncher.
4. Sign in with a Microsoft account.
5. Create a new instance.
6. In PrismLauncher, go to "Settings". Then select the "Minecraft" tab.

## Notes
- If you **rename** an instance in PrismLauncher, do not Change Instance in betterPrism. This is because PrismLauncher changes the name, not the instance ID. I do belive the folder can be renamed. If i'm wrong: contact.
